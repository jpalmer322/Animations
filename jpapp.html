<p class="p" id="p1">One of the hardest-touring artists on the road today, Rayland Baxter spent three months soul searching and obsessively songwriting at a rubber band factory turned studio. The resulting spectacular album Wide Awake is infused with the Nashville native’s easygoing, soulful sound with British Invasion melodies and rock and roll swagger.</p>

<p id="p1">Fall is here, and once again, this past summer felt shorter than the last one. It can be depressing with winter looming right around the corner but it's not all bad news though — the foliage is pretty, Halloween is pretty much the best thing ever, and all food is now pumpkin spiced.<br>To make things even better we've created the ultimate fall playlist for you.<br> As one can imagine, It's pretty hard to find songs that are exclusively about the season (and that are actually good). As such, some of the songs either simply reference the season through some choice lyrics or hint at the arrival of winter or end of summer. Either way, they're fantastic tracks and will make you feel more optimistic about the season.
